# 4bod reimplementation
 A Reimplementation of 4 Bits Of Doom in Python. 
 4 Bits of Doom is an eso-fantaly [sic] computer created by puarsliburf games for the Fantasy Computer Jam in 2017. However he apparently lost the original source code. And the reference implementation is a bit buggy so I made my own.
 
 It doesn't have an editor. You are expected to feed it an image. It supports all the formats PIL supports and NetPbm (P1), the latter allows you to edit it in a text editor. However it can't open ini files from the original editor because I have no clue how they work.
 
 by typing -ansi as the second argument you can play it in in an ANSI terminal. However this requires root priveleges in linux.
 
The program depends on Pillow and Pygame
